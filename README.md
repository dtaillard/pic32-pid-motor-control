# PID Control Demo for PIC32

This project is my final iteration of the laboratory assignments in *ECE 216: Mechtronics and Embedded Systems* at the University of Rochester.
It implements a PID controller for [Explorer 16/32 development board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/dm240001-2) from Microchip.
This particular project relies on the `PIC32795F512L` Processor Plug-In Module for the board. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To try this project, you will need the aforementioned development board and Plug-In Module.
You will also need the MPLabX IDE, although other IDEs may work equally well.

### Setup in MPLabX IDE

Clone this repository and open the project in MPLabX IDE.
